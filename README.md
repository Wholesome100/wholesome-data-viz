# Polars Cost-of-Living Analysis

This repo exists to showcase data visualization with Python using the Polars library and the Altair library.
It examines the dataset `cost-of-living-2018.csv` to produce insights into the cost of living in cities worldwide.

These insights include:
1. Examining the top 10 countries by cost of living
2. Examining the top 10 countries by purchasing power
3. Plotting the relationship between grocery and restaurant price indexes
4. Plotting the relationship between rent and cost of living indexes
5. Using a line graph to show the progression of cost of living across cities

All values utilize New York as a baseline, and the notebook can be accessed here: https://wholesome100.github.io/polars-col-analysis/
